# GiString Library for C++

Welcome to the GiString library GitHub repository! This C++ library provides a wide range of string manipulation functions designed to make the handling of strings much easier and more efficient. It is particularly suited for software engineers who need robust solutions for processing text data.

## Features

The GiString library currently includes the following core features:

- **Basic String Operations**: Transform, analyze, and edit strings with simple function calls.
- **Text Alignment and Trimming**: Adjust string alignment and remove unwanted white space.
- **Case Manipulation**: Convert text to upper case, lower case, capitalize initial letters, and more.
- **Substring Functions**: Extract or replace substrates of strings easily.
- **Validation Checks**: Check properties of the strings, such as whether it's numeric, alpha, alphanumeric, or ASCII.
- **Utility Functions**: Merge, split, and perform other utility operations on strings.

### Core Functions List

- `capitalize`, `capitalizeWords`, `swapcase`, `reverse`
- `is_palindrome`, `trim_left`, `trim_right`, `trim`
- `center`, `ljust`, `rjust`, `upper`, `lower`
- `count`, `substring`, `replace`, `split`, `join`
- `startswith`, `endswith`, `is_ascii`, `is_numeric`
- `is_alpha`, `is_alphanumeric`, `zfill`, `ltrim`, `rtrim`
- `find`, `rfind`, `contains`, `equals_ignore_case`, `insert`
- `remove`, `pop`, `push_back`, `copy`, `at`
- `max_char`, `min_char`, `iterate`, `map_chars`, `filter_chars`
- `all_of`, `none_of`, `slice`, `ascii_only`, `reduce`

## Upcoming Features

The library is actively being developed and will continue to grow with additional useful functionalities. Future updates may include:

- **Regular Expressions**: Implementation of regex patterns for advanced search and replace.
- **Localization and Internationalization Support**: Enhancements to support multiple languages and cultural norms.
- **Performance Enhancements**: Optimizations for faster processing of large text datasets.
